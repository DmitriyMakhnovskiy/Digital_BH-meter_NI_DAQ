The BH-meter was developed using a National Instruments DAQ9215 module and operated with LabVIEW-2015 to carry out real-time hysteresis loop measurements. The system utilizes the 4-channel DAQ9215 for efficient data acquisition, paired with LabVIEW for data processing and visualization. The device demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to measure hysteresis loops from very thin ferromagnetic wires. This capability made it possible to study materials with different types of magnetic anisotropy, providing useful insights into their magnetic properties. This project focused on creating a system that combines hardware and software for reliable real-time analysis of magnetic behaviour. It provides a foundation for studying ferromagnetic materials and exploring potential applications in various technological fields.

The project was carried out for the Institute for Composites Science Innovation (InCSI, http://www.composites.zju.edu.cn/en/index.asp), Zhejiang University, China.
